# AgriTech

## Overview

AgriTech is a MERN stack web application developed as a group project to connect farmers directly with buyers and reduce the role of intermediaries. The platform allows farmers to list their produce, while buyers can browse available products and purchase them at transparent prices.

We worked together on designing the system, implementing user authentication, and building separate dashboards for farmers and buyers. The application supports real-time updates and regional language options to make it usable for people from different areas. Our goal was to ensure fair pricing for farmers and improve trust and transparency in the agricultural supply chain.


## Problem Statement

In the traditional agricultural market, farmers usually depend on middlemen to sell their produce, which often reduces their profit margins. Many farmers do not get real-time information about market prices or demand, while consumers end up paying higher prices.
